My view of the pre-interview question events
1) I mis-interpreted the time constraints for the test, it said the 
   test should take 30 minutes, it also said the answer was due 
   by 0100 GMT. 
2) At first I wanted to do in-place move to eliminate using an extra 
   array and copy, I could not see the solution.
3) after I had a solution for the first test case I noticed that the 
   test had timed out; at that point I assumed I had lost the 
   opportunity, but I sent Bryan a note and eventually a copy of my 
first solution.
4) after feedback from Bryan, I assumed I was not a good candidate;
5) as an exercise I re-worked the solution to work correctly with 3 
   more test cases as described by Bryan.  I did this as a training 
   exercise for myself, since I know similar issues will present 
   themselves in future interviews and I need to be prepaired and 
   I wanted to know the proper solution.
6) I do the last step for all failed technical interviews to ensure I 
   use the interview as a learning experience.

as an asside I have noticed that my first 3 interviews when starting 
a job search seem to be loss leader; that is I almost always fail
to secure a position from the first interview, because I need the
practice to understand how to present my answers and I need time
to remember how to answer Computer Science 101 questions :-)
